This R Studio Project contains code and publicly-available demo data from NHANES for a practical training session on basic R usage for those not familiar with R or R Studio. It is part of a sequence of modules on practical survey data analysis with R prepared by CDC for INS staff. This module relies heavily on base R to avoid dependency on knowledge of tidyverse.  

Note: Code comments are in Portuguese.
